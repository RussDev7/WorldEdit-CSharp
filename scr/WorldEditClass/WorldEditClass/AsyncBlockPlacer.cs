       =======================================================================================================
       Async Block Placement Queue
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Purpose
       • Decouple world-edit block placement from command execution.
       • Pace block edits with a per-frame budget to avoid stalls/hitches while large regions are applied.
       • Use the vanilla network message (AlterBlockMessage) for both host and client -> vanilla-safe.

       Threading Model
       • Producer threads: Call Enqueue(...) from any thread to queue a (position, blockID) edit.
       • Main thread:      Pump() drains up to MaxBlocksPerFrame each frame and sends AlterBlockMessage.
         - Host:   The host's own message is received/applied locally by the engine (consistent with client path).
         - Client: Messages go to the host using ReliableInOrder.
       • IMPORTANT: Never touch BlockTerrain or other engine singletons off-thread. Pump() runs on main thread.

       Integration Points
       • Commands (/set, /sphere, /replace, ...): replace direct PlaceBlock(...) with AsyncBlockPlacer.Enqueue(...).
       • Harmony patch: Call Pump() once per frame via a Postfix on CastleMinerZGame.Update (or DNAGame.Update).

       Performance Knobs
       • MaxBlocksPerFrame (int): Per-frame budget. Higher = faster throughput, but more risk of small hitches.
         Start 1500-4000; tune by feel and target hardware/network conditions.

       Safety Notes
       • Validate block IDs before enqueue if you compute IDs dynamically; invalid IDs can cause host lookups to fail.
       • Pump() early-outs if there's no active LocalNetworkGamer (session not ready yet).
       • This implementation uses only AlterBlockMessage (no custom bulk message) to remain compatible with vanilla hosts.
       • If you need to wait for all queued edits (e.g., before screenshot/undo fences), add a simple IsIdle check/poll.

       Diagnostics
       • A lightweight telemetry line (see bottom of Pump) shows per-frame drain, pending count, and current budget.
       • If the log never shows drains while you're enqueuing edits, your Harmony Postfix isn't firing each frame.

       Known Limits
       • Throughput for clients is ultimately limited by the session's ReliableInOrder pipeline and network latency.
       • On host, sending AlterBlockMessage to self is slower than calling SetBlock directly, but preserves vanilla flow.

       Fences & Utilities
       • IsIdle: Returns true when the local queue is empty (i.e., everything you enqueued has been sent).
         Note:   On clients this does not guarantee the host has *applied* yet-only that you've finished sending.
       • WaitUntilIdleAsync(pollMs): Simple awaitable helper if you want to delay a follow-up action (e.g., screenshot).
         Example:
             foreach (var p in region) AsyncBlockPlacer.Enqueue(p, id);
             await AsyncBlockPlacer.WaitUntilIdleAsync(10); // Wait until our queue is drained.
