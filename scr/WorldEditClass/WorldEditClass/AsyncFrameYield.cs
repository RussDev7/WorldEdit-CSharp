    /*
       =======================================================================================================
       Async Frame Yield / Next-Frame Awaiter
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Purpose
       • Provide a safe, awaitable "yield until next frame" primitive for long-running world-edit operations.
       • Prevent hard stalls by breaking large loops across frames while staying on the game thread.

       Threading Model
       • Any thread:  Can call NextFrame() to obtain a Task that completes on the next Update tick.
       • Game thread: Must call Pump() once per frame (e.g., from a Harmony Postfix on DNAGame.Update).
         - Pump() completes all queued waiters and runs their continuations inline on the game thread.

       Why NOT RunContinuationsAsynchronously?
       • We intentionally want continuations to execute on the Pump() call site (the game thread) so that
         follow-up code can safely touch engine singletons (BlockTerrain, networking, UI) without cross-thread
         access violations.

       Integration Points
       • Harmony patch: Call FrameYield.Pump() once per frame (ideally before other per-frame pumps).
       • Long commands: Sprinkle "await FrameYield.NextFrame()" (or a time-budgeted helper) inside heavy loops.

       Typical Usage
       • var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
         for (...) {
             ...heavy work...
             if (sw.ElapsedMilliseconds > 6) { sw.Restart(); await FrameYield.NextFrame(); }
         }

       Safety Notes
       • Pump() must be called regularly. If Pump() is not running (paused menu / no Update), NextFrame()
         tasks will not complete.
       • This class intentionally has no cancellation; callers should add CancellationToken checks as needed.
